# Custom Icons Enchanced for Classic wow 1.12 ( It work on Turtle-wow ) 
Floating Icon for Vanilla ( Turtle-wow ) 1.12+

The main purpose of this addons is to add controller custom icon anywhere on your screen ( for its mainly for steamdeck with vanilla version 1.12 + ) . Since we don't have the best and awesome Consoleport available on classic 1.12 wow . Someone found a work around but was missing some visual enhancement . Please take note that im just a hobbyist and not a professional coder . Its my first addon . Feel free to modify it or polish it . At first i tried to integrate it to DragonflyUI from a post i saw on Turtle-wow forum but i had no time to mess with it i might try it or ask the guy if he could add it or i will just try to make adjustment from time to time .

Its basic but it does the JOB !
